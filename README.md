# Product Overview
This solution intelligently links & combines records from two related data sources into a single master record. The module acts as a crucial component in Master Data Management. It assigns a common ID to records belonging to the same entity/duplicates. The probabilistic linkage algorithm provides the flexibility to find duplicate records based on a required match percentage given the columns of interest. The Data Linkage module is applicable in scenarios such as: (a) Linking medical records of patients from different health care providers (b) Linking information from different external data sources (c) Linking census records of persons over a period of time. (d) Linking consumer product information from different sources (reviews, sellers etc.,)
