# Data-Deduplication-Record-Linkage

# Product Overview
This solution intelligently links & combines records from two related data sources into a single master record. The module acts as a crucial component in Master Data Management. It assigns a common ID to records belonging to the same entity/duplicates. The probabilistic linkage algorithm provides the flexibility to find duplicate records based on a required match percentage given the columns of interest. The Data Linkage module is applicable in scenarios such as: (a) Linking medical records of patients from different health care providers (b) Linking information from different external data sources (c) Linking census records of persons over a period of time. (d) Linking consumer product information from different sources (reviews, sellers etc.,)

# Product Highlight
  * Data collected on any entity from different sources can have different formatting conventions, errors, missing values and even recorded at different time periods. Linking such sources poses a challenge. The probabilistic data linkage algorithm solves this problem by computing a match probability between entities from two sources. Based on a required threshold, one can identify/link the same entity from the two sources of data.
 * The algorithm is un-supervised thereby reducing the time and cost of acquiring labelled data for training/re-training the algorithm. The module integrates well with ETL processes and can act as a critical component in MDM.
